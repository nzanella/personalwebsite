According to this page: `https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button`, normally, Facebook only scrapes your site for Open Graph information once a day. You need to manually go to the Facebook Debugger Tool `https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/` and paste your URL into the box and click on the `Debug button` and then on the `Fetch new scrape information` button each time you update your page's Open Graph information to see the updates in the Facebook sharer page once you update your HTML.
